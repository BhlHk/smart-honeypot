# Smart Honeypot + ML Detection

This repository contains the dataset, trained model, and SHAP explainability plots for the smart honeypot security agent described in our paper.

## 📁 Contents
- `data/`: Augmented CSV dataset used for training
- `models/`: Trained Random Forest model (`.pkl`) and feature scaler
- `shap_plots/`: SHAP explainability plots

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Load the dataset from `data/smart_honeypot_dataset.csv`
2. Use `models/rf_best_model.pkl` and `scaler_best_model.pkl` to make predictions
3. See SHAP plots for model interpretation
